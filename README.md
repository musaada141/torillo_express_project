# torillo_express_project
This is the final project on node and express
In this project, we were instructed to creat a basic CRUD operation of Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete
We perform this operation in a JSON file 
The project has a JSON file of hard coded contact list in a form of an array of object where we will Create(to add more contacts), Retrieve(find or get existing contacts), Update(to make changes to existing contacts and Delete(to remove contacts)
We did not use a database because it is a simple project for basic CRUD operation
We have our server.js file where we listen to our port and express simplify which route will be used
The router where we have our end points
The controller where we define our logic
